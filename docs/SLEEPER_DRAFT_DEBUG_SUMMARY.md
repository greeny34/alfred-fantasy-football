# Sleeper Draft API Debug Summary

## 🔍 Issues Identified

### Draft ID: `1256139365948604416`
### User ID Issues: `352200144369963008` vs `1256092194675113984`

---

## 🔴 Problem #1: Wrong User ID
**Issue:** "Could not identify your team"

**Root Cause:** 
- You were using user ID `352200144369963008`
- But this draft only contains user ID `1256092194675113984`
- The `draft_order` field only has: `{'1256092194675113984': 4}`

**Solution:**
- Use the correct user ID: `1256092194675113984`
- Or implement auto-detection from available users in `draft_order`

---

## 🔴 Problem #2: Empty Team IDs in Picks
**Issue:** All picks showing "Team " (empty string)

**Root Cause:**
- Most picks have `picked_by: ''` (empty string)
- Only the human player has a proper user ID in `picked_by`
- This is common in mock drafts where CPU teams don't have user IDs

**Original Wrong Logic:**
```python
team_id = pick.get('picked_by', 'Unknown')  # Results in empty strings
```

**Fixed Logic:**
```python
draft_slot = pick.get('draft_slot')
team_id = slot_to_roster_id.get(str(draft_slot), draft_slot)
```

## 🔴 Problem #3: Wrong Turn Calculation
**Issue:** Showing "Team 4's turn" when user said "it's my turn"

**Root Cause:**
- Turn calculation was using wrong team identification
- Not properly mapping draft slots to roster IDs

**Fixed Turn Calculation:**
```python
def get_whose_turn_fixed(draft_info, picks):
    settings = draft_info.get('settings', {})
    total_teams = settings.get('teams', 10)
    is_snake = draft_info.get('type') == 'snake'
    
    total_picks = len(picks)
    current_round = (total_picks // total_teams) + 1
    pick_in_round = total_picks % total_teams
    
    if is_snake and current_round % 2 == 0:
        next_draft_slot = total_teams - pick_in_round
    else:
        next_draft_slot = pick_in_round + 1
    
    # KEY FIX: Map draft slot to roster ID
    slot_to_roster = draft_info.get('slot_to_roster_id', {})
    team_id = slot_to_roster.get(str(next_draft_slot), next_draft_slot)
    
    return team_id
```

## 📊 API Structure Analysis

### Draft Info Structure:
```json
{
  "draft_order": {"1256092194675113984": 4},
  "slot_to_roster_id": {
    "1": 1, "2": 2, "3": 3, "4": 4, "5": 5,
    "6": 6, "7": 7, "8": 8, "9": 9, "10": 10
  },

    "teams": 10,
    "rounds": 15
  },
  "type": "snake"
}
```

### Pick Structure:
```json
{
  "draft_slot": 1,          // ✅ Use this for team identification
  "picked_by": "",          // ❌ Often empty in mock drafts
  "roster_id": null,        // ❌ Often null
  "player_id": "4866",
  "round": 1,
  "pick_no": 1
}
```

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Team Identification
```python
def identify_user_team_fixed(draft_info, user_id):
    draft_order = draft_info.get('draft_order', {})
    
    if user_id in draft_order:
        draft_slot = draft_order[user_id]
        slot_to_roster = draft_info.get('slot_to_roster_id', {})
        team_id = slot_to_roster.get(str(draft_slot), draft_slot)
        
        return {
            'team_id': team_id,
            'draft_slot': draft_slot,
            'found': True
        }
    
    return {'found': False}
```

### 2. Fixed Pick Team Assignment
```python
def assign_picks_to_teams_fixed(picks, draft_info):
    slot_to_roster = draft_info.get('slot_to_roster_id', {})
    
    for pick in picks:
        draft_slot = pick.get('draft_slot')
        if draft_slot:
            pick['team_id'] = slot_to_roster.get(str(draft_slot), draft_slot)
        else:
            pick['team_id'] = 'Unknown'
    
    return picks
```

### 3. Auto-Detection of User ID
```python
if not self.user_id and self.draft_order:
    available_users = list(self.draft_order.keys())
    if len(available_users) == 1:
        self.user_id = available_users[0]
        print(f"🎯 Auto-detected user ID: {self.user_id}")
```

## 🧪 Test Results

**Before Fixes:**
- ❌ "Could not identify your team"
- ❌ All picks showing "Team " (empty)
- ❌ Wrong turn calculation

**After Fixes:**
- ✅ Auto-detected User ID: `1256092194675113984`
- ✅ Team ID: `4`
- ✅ All teams properly assigned (1-10)
- ✅ Turn calculation working correctly

**Team Roster Distribution:**
```
Team 1: 15 picks
Team 2: 15 picks  
Team 3: 15 picks
Team 4 (YOU): 15 picks  ← Correctly identified as user's team
Team 5: 15 picks
...
Team 10: 15 picks
```

1. **`debug_sleeper_draft_structure.py`** - Comprehensive API structure analysis
2. **`sleeper_draft_issues_analysis.py`** - Issue identification and solutions
3. **`fixed_sleeper_assistant.py`** - Corrected draft assistant implementation
4. **`test_fixed_logic.py`** - Validation of fixes

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

1. **Always use `draft_slot` + `slot_to_roster_id`** for team identification
2. **Don't rely on `picked_by`** in mock drafts (often empty)
3. **Auto-detect user ID** when only one human participant
4. **Validate API responses** before using data
5. **Mock drafts behave differently** than real league drafts

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Update your draft assistant with the fixed logic from `fixed_sleeper_assistant.py`
2. Use the correct user ID or implement auto-detection
3. Test with other draft IDs to ensure robustness
4. Consider handling edge cases (multiple users, different draft types)

The debug revealed that the core issues were related to wrong user ID usage and improper team identification logic. The fixed implementation correctly handles mock drafts and provides accurate team identification and turn calculation.
